# Horiseon-Accessiblity

Horiseon Social Solutions provides online social media marking and search engine optimization. I optimized the html to fit in accessibility standards as well as added semantic elemnts to the html. 

## Code Snippit
Here is an example where I added alt attributes to an image within the html
``` html
<article class="search-engine-optimization">
            <img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" alt="Office supplies on desk" />
            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.
